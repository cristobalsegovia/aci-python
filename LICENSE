"The Unofficial ACI Guide [Beer-ware License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beerware)" 
Revision 1


Any code in this repository is provided by the Unofficial ACI Guide team and is free for you to use with
your ACI environment (it's probably not useful to you without ACI, but you're welcome to try anyway). 

It comes with no warranty and no guarantee of functionality.
You can do whatever you want with this stuff, and at your own risk, too.

If we meet some day and you think this stuff is worth it, and it's not during an official customer event, 
you can buy us a beer in return.
